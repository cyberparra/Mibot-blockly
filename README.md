INTRODUCTION
this project aim to develop a simplified visual programming language devoted to Mibot, a DIY robot based on micro:bit
The scope is to create semplified blocks for controlling the robot movement; avoiding to manage the control of single pins to start and stop the motors

The coding environment is based on Nodejs and blockly
